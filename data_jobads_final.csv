a career in hermitage clinic will ensure you are joining a diverse, dynamic and enthusiastic team of professionals, passionate about developing services to ensure we provide the best care in the most modern of facilities.

role summary
the main purpose of the post is to develop the expert role and supporting documentation, to enable the individual nurse to meet the nmbi criteria for registration as an advanced nurse practitioner as set out in advanced practice (nursing) standards and requirements (nmbi, 2017). the individual will undertake the academic preparation and develop the clinical and leadership skills, competencies and knowledge required to meet the criteria to be registered as a ranp with nmbi. the scope of the c/ranp role must reflect the incremental development of expertise and as such, the c/ranp cannot deliver care as an autonomous practitioner.

furthermore, the c/ranp will develop and submit their personal portfolio and all other necessary documentation to nmbi in order to register as a ranp if not currently registered.

the value of the nursing contribution as a distinct profession must be safeguarded and articulated in the development of new services led by advanced nurse practitioners, complementing rather than replacing current services delivered by doctors (nmbi 2017 p.9).

the overall purpose of the post is to provide safe, timely, evidenced based nurse-led care to patients at an advanced nursing level .this involves undertaking and documenting a complete episode of patient care (assess, diagnose, plan, treat and discharge patients) according to collaboratively agreed protocols and scope of practice in the clinical setting; demonstrating advanced clinical and theoretical knowledge, critical thinking, clinical leadership and decision making skills.

the advanced practice role demonstrates a high degree of knowledge, skill and experience that is applied within the nurse-patient/client relationship to achieve optimal outcomes through critical analysis, problem solving and accurate decision-making (nmbi, 2017).
central to this is the provision of quality care, a safe environment and processes for patients by the use of evidence based clinical guidelines that address patient expectations, promote wellness and evaluate care given.

the role will provide clinical leadership and professional scholarship in order to develop nursing practice and health policy at local, regional and national level.

the role will contribute to nursing research to shape and advance nursing practice, education and health care policy at local, national and international levels.

why dublin
dublin is the most highly populated county in ireland, however the city maintains a relaxed vibe and offers a host of amenities in pleasant surrounds. unlike some parts of ireland, dublin operates an excellent transport system, meaning it's easy to get around the city, county and indeed the country. dublin is steeped in history which you can enjoy every time you take a stroll through the city. whilst dublin is home to around one million people the city is actually a relatively small place and getting across it on foot is feasible. the city is ideal for nature lovers/walking enthusiasts, due to its numerous parks and gardens and access to its stunning coastline. for foodies, it offers all types of world cuisines.
