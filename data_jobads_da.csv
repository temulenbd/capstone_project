You’ll support various initiatives outlined in the project roadmap for the IT and HR organizations.
Why it’s a big deal…
As Conga continues in our digital transformation, we have big initiatives to scale to support the needs of the business. In addition to supporting the optimization of the Workday platform, you’ll have high visibility and the opportunity to provide meaningful changes and support to our HR Operations, Rewards, and Benefits teams.
Are you the person we’re looking for?
Related Experience. You’ve developed an expertise in your 7 plus years in IT with 5 (or more) years of techno-functional experience supporting and implementing Workday around (Studio, BIRT, CCBs, CCW, and payroll and benefit Integrations). You also have have familiarity with a mix of different modules (Core HCM, Advanced Comp, Payroll, Benefits, Absence, Security etc.). You’ve grown your skillset in designing, modeling, reporting, data analysis, and integrations, including various ongoing weekly/monthly feeds.
Project Management. You’ve successfully led full-cycle implementations using Agile methodology. You support through gathering requirements, creating designs, conducting testing, and post-production support.

Analytical thinker and creative problem solver. You’re able to see issues holistically and follow the flow of the stack to get to the root of the matter - a key skill in this role.

You’re not only proactive about completing your own work, but when you sense the need to introduce a project that will benefit the team or the organization - even if it’s outside your scope of work - you put a proposal together, talk to the team about it, and own it. And that also goes back to having an entrepreneurial spirit.
Strong attention to detail. The Conga revenue lifecycle management solution showcases a wide variety of use cases, across multiple regions and languages. Being able to quickly QA campaigns and provide feedback to both Agency Partners and internal stakeholders is necessary for success.

You are skilled at reading and adapting to different communication styles. When you speak you are clear and concise. Your strong listening skills foster connections and allow you to accurately collect the right information so you can resolve issues in the most expedient way.
Continuous Learner. You’ve worked on problems that required you to review a variety of factors and learn new technologies to find solutions. You consistently look to improve and continue to innovate in your technology skillset, best practices, and processes.

Working from our European Headquarters in Dublin’s city centre, you will begin your career by being immersed in our education programme designed to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world problem solving.

Quantitative Researchers are seated at the heart of our trading floor, communicating regularly with traders seeking their insight, and connecting ideas with other quants and the technology team.

Education: Our industry leading education programme is designed with the goal of bringing researchers into the world of quantitative trading. The programme features trading and financial math classes, and introductory projects to market microstructure and financial data analysis. We also provide structured training in Python and programming in a collaborative production environment.

Development: Everyone on the QR programme is paired with an experienced quant, who’ll mentor you throughout the programme. You will work with people who share a passion for mathematics, problem-solving, game theory and technology. We encourage continued learning in SIG. Upon completion of the programme, our quants are encouraged to attend academic conferences to keep connected with the research community.

Technology: Our QR team leverages from SIG’s in-house large-scale computing resources and other state-of-the-art technology.

Culture: Our non-hierarchical culture allows employees of every level to thrive. We buck the trend in the financial world – the environment is casual, collaborative and we focus on continuous development, no matter how long you’ve been in SIG.

Perks: Based in Ireland’s Financial Services Centre, in the heart of Dublin’s city centre, our employees avail of free onsite catering, a games room, and a large in house gym, to name but a few of our favourite perks. We also offer temporary accommodation and guidance through the relocation process if required.
