The development of Hospital Groups may require the post-holder to adopt a different reporting relationship and additional accountabilities. Full consultation will take place in advance of any such change.

NOTE: The extent and speed of change in the delivery of health care is such that adaptability is essential at this level of appointment. The appointee will be required to maintain, enhance and develop their knowledge, skills and aptitudes necessary to respond to this changing environment. They will also be required to participate in and support the Hospital’s Digital transformation strategy which may impact work processes and role profiles in the future. The Job Description must therefore be regarded as an outline of the major areas of accountability at the present time, which will be reviewed and assessed on an on-going basis as advancements and developments evolve.

Blackrock Health Hermitage Clinic is a state of the art 160 bed healthcare facility ideally located on at the junction of the N4 and M50 in Lucan, Co Dublin. The hospital provides a wide range of Emergency, Ambulatory, Interventional and Diagnostic care to for Adults and some services for Children. As a member of Ireland's newest private health care group, Blackrock Health we are dedicated in ensuring our mission, vision and values (https://www.hermitageclinic.ie/) are our guiding principles in ensuring our patients and staff have a world class experience.

A career in Hermitage Clinic will ensure you are joining a diverse, dynamic and enthusiastic team of professionals, passionate about developing services to ensure we provide the best care in the most modern of facilities.

Role Summary
The main purpose of the post is to develop the expert role and supporting documentation, to enable the individual nurse to meet the NMBI Criteria for Registration as an Advanced Nurse Practitioner as set out in Advanced Practice (Nursing) Standards and Requirements (NMBI, 2017). The individual will undertake the academic preparation and develop the clinical and leadership skills, competencies and knowledge required to meet the criteria to be registered as a RANP with NMBI. The scope of the c/rANP role must reflect the incremental development of expertise and as such, the c/rANP cannot deliver care as an autonomous practitioner.

Furthermore, the c/rANP will develop and submit their personal portfolio and all other necessary documentation to NMBI in order to register as a RANP if not currently registered.

The value of the nursing contribution as a distinct profession must be safeguarded and articulated in the development of new services led by advanced nurse practitioners, complementing rather than replacing current services delivered by doctors (NMBI 2017 p.9).

The overall purpose of the post is to provide safe, timely, evidenced based nurse-led care to patients at an advanced nursing level .This involves undertaking and documenting a complete episode of patient care (assess, diagnose, plan, treat and discharge patients) according to collaboratively agreed protocols and scope of practice in the clinical setting; demonstrating advanced clinical and theoretical knowledge, critical thinking, clinical leadership and decision making skills.

The advanced practice role demonstrates a high degree of knowledge, skill and experience that is applied within the nurse-patient/client relationship to achieve optimal outcomes through critical analysis, problem solving and accurate decision-making (NMBI, 2017).
Central to this is the provision of quality care, a safe environment and processes for patients by the use of evidence based clinical guidelines that address patient expectations, promote wellness and evaluate care given.

The role will provide clinical leadership and professional scholarship in order to develop nursing practice and health policy at local, regional and national level.

The role will contribute to nursing research to shape and advance nursing practice, education and health care policy at local, national and international levels.

The Neuroscience Directorate (Neuro Cent) at Beaumont Hospital, Dublin is the national referral centre for neurological and neurosurgical conditions in the Republic of Ireland. The directorate consists of 4 main ward areas (with just over 130 beds), a Neuro Intensive care unit with 10 beds, outpatient facilities, an ENT clinic (ear, nose, and throat), and a specialist investigatory unit (EEG, EMG, Neurophysiology). Neurosurgery, neurology, stroke medicine, neurophysiology, oto-laryngology (ENT), ophthalmology, and oral maxilla-facial surgery are some of the sub-specialisms that are covered by the suite of services available within the directorate. We provide advanced surgical, investigatory, and interventional therapies for patients presenting with a variety of neuroscience and head and neck disease states. We are also the national referral centre for cochlear transplantation in Ireland.

Registered nurses within the directorate play a pivotal role in assessing and responding to changes in the patient's clinical condition, supporting patients and families through the rehabilitation journey, and contributing to the evolution of evidence based practice.
