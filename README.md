Topic: A comparative evaluation of text representation techniques for content-based job recommendation system

Summary: The investigation conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different text representation techniques—BERT (encoding), Word2Vec (embedding), and TF-IDF with BoW—within our custom Job Recommendation System (JRS) framework has provided valuable insights. Through meticulously designed experiments aimed at assessing these techniques' performance in classifying job advertisements, calculating cosine similarity scores, and evaluating human judgments, we have discovered that each method offers unique strengths and applications within the Job Recommendation System framework.
