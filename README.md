_Topic:_ **A Comparative Evaluation of Text Representation Techniques for Content-Based Job Recommendation System**

_Summary:_ To address the challenge of information overload in human resources management, I immersed myself in the domain of Job Recommendation Systems (JRS). This endeavor involved meticulously studying and analyzing almost 300 research papers in the field of Recommendation Systems (RS). Through this extensive review, I identified a gap in the literature regarding the use of text representation techniques within JRS. Specifically, I observed a lack of comprehensive assessments and comparisons of the outcomes produced by JRSs that employ both traditional and innovative text representation methods. This research is addressed to sought this gap by conducting experiments involving real-world participants.

With this research, I compared the effectiveness of three primary text representation models: the conventional TF-IDF method, the distributed Word2Vec model, and the cutting-edge transformer encoders, exemplified by BERT. It is important to note that BERT is one of the first transformer models that continues to exhibit state-of-the-art capabilities across various NLP tasks to this day and remains one of the few Large Language Models (LLM) freely available for public use.

Given the absence of a framework for conducting comparative evaluation analyses of text representation techniques within JRSs in the existing literature, I decided to create my own JRS, specifically tailored to address the primary research question and objectives of my study. This unique system, exclusive to my research, underwent thorough scrutiny through a series of experiments.

Firstly, the creation of this novel RS involved a meticulous examination of each component, followed by the implementation of two offline and one online experiment with research participants. In the initial experiment, three distinct text representation techniques were evaluated alongside benchmark results using a classification model to mitigate any potential biases. Subsequently, the second experiment scrutinized the mathematical outcomes of these techniques through descriptive and inferential statistics.

Lastly, the third experiment assessed the effectiveness of the final output from the newly developed JRS through online interactions with experiment participants. Their evaluations were then subjected to a thorough analysis using descriptive and inferential statistics. Through a comprehensive examination and detailed analysis of the entire RS, all results were meticulously justified and documented. Additionally, I would like to emphasize that this project is not only the evaluation and comparison of different techniques but also the creation of a framework for assessing the quality of recommendation systems, which can be further developed and used for benchmarking content-based JRS.
